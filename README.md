# Health App (Deployed by Flask)

Welcome to the Health App repository This application aims to provide predictions for various health conditions using machine learning models. Whether it's predicting heart disease, diabetes, or pneumonia, my app leverages ML & Deep Learning algorithms to assist users in understanding and managing their health risks.

## Features

- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various health metrics.
- **Diabetes Prediction:** Predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on demographic and health data.
- **Pneumonia Prediction:** Predicts the presence of pneumonia in a chest X-ray image using deep learning.
